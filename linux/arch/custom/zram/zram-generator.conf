[zram0]
# The fraction of memory to use as ZRAM. For example, if the machine
# has 1 GiB, and zram-fraction=0.25, then the zram device will have
# 256 MiB. Values in the range 0.10â€“0.50 are recommended.
#
# The default is 0.5.
zram-fraction = 0.50

# The compression algorithm to use for the zram device,
# or leave unspecified to keep the kernel default.
